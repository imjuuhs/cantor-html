      <p><em>Girl, tell me what you're doing on the other side? <br>
	  And so, just tell me, what you're doing with that other guy? <br>
	  <br>
	  'Cause I ain't got patience to slow down the bass <br>
	  All your girlfriends are wasted <br>
	  They need it, they chase it <br>
	  Face it, you want it, you crave it <br>
	  Believe when I say that you'll know once you taste it <br>
	  <br>
	  All of your friends have been here for too long <br>
	  They must be waiting for you to move on <br>
	  Girl, I'm not with it, I'm way too far gone ...<br>
	  I'm not ready, eyes heavy now<br>
	  Heart on your sleeve like you've never been loved<br>
		Running in circles, now look what you've done<br>
		Give you my word as you take it and run<br>
		Wish you'd let me stay, I'm ready now<br>
		<br>
		Just give some time and space to realize that you<br>
		Were busy lying sleeping 'round with other guys<br>
		<br>
		And what the hell were we?<br>
		Tell me we weren't just friends<br>
		This doesn't make much sense, no<br>
		But I'm not hurt, I'm tense<br>
		'Cause I'll be fine without you babe<br>
		<br>
		All of your friends have been here for too long<br>
		They must be waiting for you to move on<br>
		Girl, I'm not with it I'm way too far gone<br>
		I'm not ready, eyes heavy now<br>
		Heart on your sleeve like you've never been loved<br>
		Running in circles, now look what you've done<br>
		Give you my word as you take it and run<br>
		Wish you'd let me stay, I'm ready now<br>
		Wish you'd let me stay, I'm ready now<br>
		I'm not ready, eyes heavy now<br>
		All of your friends have been here for too long<br>
		They must be waiting for you to move on<br>
		Girl, I'm not with it I'm way too far gone<br>
		I'm not ready, eyes heavy now<br>
		Heart on your sleeve like you've never been loved<br>
		Running in circles, now look what you've done<br>
		Give you my word as you take it and run<br>
		Wish you'd let me stay, I'm ready now<br>
		I'm not ready, eyes heavy now<br>
