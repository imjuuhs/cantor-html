      <p><em>Yeah<br>
	I bet you feel it now, baby<br>
	Especially since we've only known each other one day<br>
	But I've gotta work shit out, baby<br>
	I'm exorcising demons, got 'em running 'round the block now<br>
	<br>
	Location drop, now <br>
	<br>
	Pedal to the floor like you running from the cops now<br>
	Oh, what a cop out, uh<br>
	You picked a dance with the devil, and you lucked out (yeah) <br>
	<br>
	The water's getting colder, let me in your ocean, swim<br>
	Out in California, I've been forward stroking, swim<br>
	So hard to ignore ya, 'specially when I'm smoking, swim<br>
	World is on my shoulders, keep your body open, swim<br>
	I'm swimming, I'm swimming, I'm swimming, yeah<br>
	I'm swimming, I'm swimming, I'm swimming, yeah<br>
	Out in California, I've been forward stroking, swim<br>
	So hard to ignore ya, keep your body open, swim <br>
	<br>
	Pop a couple pills in the daytime, uh<br>
	Heard you got a friend, what her head like? Uh<br>
	Probably should've fucked on the first night, uh<br>
	Now I gotta wait for the green light, uh<br>
	I don't wanna wait for no green light, uh<br>
	Narcolepsy got me feeling stage fright, uh<br>
	Luckily I float at insane heights<br>
	Luckily, luckily, luckily, yah <br>
	<br>
	Location drop, now<br>
	Pedal to the floor like you runnin' from the cops now<br>
	Oh, what a cop out, uh<br>
	You picked a dance with the devil, and you lucked out (yeah)<br>
	<br>
	The water's getting colder, let me in your ocean, swim<br>
	Out in California, I've been forward stroking, swim<br>
	So hard to ignore ya, 'specially when I'm smoking, swim<br>
	World is on my shoulders, keep your body open, swim<br>
	I'm swimming, I'm swimming, I'm swimming, yeah<br>
	I'm swimming, I'm swimming, I'm swimming, yeah<br>
	Out in California, I've been forward stroking, swim<br>
	<br>
	So hard to ignore ya, keep your body open, swim, uh <br>
	<br>
	Swim, push the water to the edge and watch it drip<br>
	Check your footing, don't get caught up in the rip, no<br>
	I know I said I'd call, I never did, no<br>
	Swim, swim now <br>
	I can take you even though I've never been there<br>
	The tide has currently been thrashing around me again and again, yeah<br>
	And I've been drowning for a minute, your body keeps pulling me in, girl <br>
	<br>
	The water's getting colder, let me in your ocean, swim<br>
	Out in California, I've been forward stroking, swim<br>
	So hard to ignore ya, 'specially when I'm smoking, swim<br>
	World is on my shoulders, keep your body open, swim<br>
	I'm swimming, I'm swimming, I'm swimming, yeah<br>
	I'm swimming, I'm swimming, I'm swimming, yeah<br>
	Out in California, I've been forward stroking, swim<br>
	So hard to ignore ya, keep your body open, swim<br>
