      <p><em>Yeah<br>
	I've been catching planes for the fun of it<br>
	Then I'll be watching fame turn to punishment<br>
	The weather's only sunny when I'm under it<br>
	And I haven't really changed, yeah I'm just confident<br>
	I'm just fucking lucky I was born with it<br>
	A hundred million people couldn't deal with this<br>
	I've been tryna grow 'cause people kill for it<br>
	This mental pressure got me popping pills and shit<br>
	<br>
	Uh, but I'm into it, I'm into it<br>
	<br>
	Say she wanna fuck me later<br>
	Girl, I'm into it, I'm into it, I'm into it<br>
	This mental pressure got me popping pills and shit<br>
	Uh, but I'm into it, I'm into it<br>
	I'm getting way too deep<br>
	I'm fucking into it<br>
	<br>
	I'm into it, yeah I'm into it<br>
	I wouldn't change it for the world<br>
	I'm fucking into it<br>
	<br>
	I've been on the road since I was sixteen<br>
	They don't really notice I how I see things<br>
	These girls they come and go between my bedsheets<br>
	And I've been doing blue and causing big scenes, yeah<br>
	Pull up and I'm higher than the big trees, yeah<br>
	She don't really like it but she needs me, yeah<br>
	She saying she don't really miss me<br>
	But fuck it, now I'm faded after all things, yeah<br>
	<br>
	But I'm into it, I'm into it<br>
	Say she wanna fuck me later<br>
	Girl, I'm into it, I'm into it, I'm into it<br>
	This mental pressure got me popping pills and shit<br>
	Uh, but I'm into it, I'm into it<br>
	I'm getting way too deep<br>
	I'm fucking into it<br>
	I'm into it, yeah I'm into it<br>
	I wouldn't change it for the world<br>
	I'm fucking into it<br>
	<br>
	Girl, I'm into it, I'm into it<br>
	Say she wanna fuck me later<br>
	Girl, I'm into it<br>
	I'm into it, I'm into it<br>
