      <p><em>Girl, tell me what you're doing on the other side? <br>
	  And so, just tell me, what you're doing with that other guy? <br>
	  'Cause I ain't got patience to slow down the bass <br>
	  All your girlfriends are wasted <br>
	  They need it, they chase it <br>
	  Face it, you want it, you crave it <br>
	  Believe when I say that you'll know once you taste it <br>
	  All of your friends have been here for too long <br>
	  They must be waiting for you to move on <br>
	  Girl, I'm not with it, I'm way too far gone ...<br></em></p>
