      <p><em>Yeah <br>
	  I've been catching planes for the fun of it <br>
	  Then I'll be watching fame turn to punishment <br>
	  The weather's only sunny when I'm under it <br>
	  And I haven't really changed, yeah I'm just confident <br>
	  I'm just fucking lucky I was born with it <br>
	  A hundred million people couldn't deal with this <br>
	  I've been tryna grow 'cause people kill for it <br>
	  This mental pressure got me popping pills and shit ...</em></p>
